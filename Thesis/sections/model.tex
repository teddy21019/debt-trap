International debt often lacks perfect enforcement, therefore the government holds the decision of whether to repay the debts or go default, based on the comparison of the future values \citep*{Eaton-Gersovitz-81}. Thus, default can be considered an optimal policy for a country.
If a country chooses to default, it faces the consequence of being excluded from the international credit market for a period of time and  would have to rely solely on its own financial resources. However, it would also benefit from not having to pay the interest on the debt.
Moreover, studies have pointed out that sovereign debt defaults are often accompanied by a devaluation of the currency; \citet*{Reinhart02} refers to this phenomenon as ``Twin Ds.''
Empirical analysis by \citet*{Na-18} further observes that the devaluation rate often decreases after the time of default, suggesting that the Twin Ds phenomenon is the joint result of an optimal policy.
They proposed a model that incorporates two key frictions: limited commitment to repay external debts and downward nominal wage rigidity.
It is a decentralized version of the Eaton-Gersovitz sovereign debt model.
The model predicts that default will occur only after a series of increasingly negative output shocks. Prior to default, domestic absorption experiences a severe contraction, which leads to a decline in demand for labor. However, due to downward nominal wage rigidity, real wages fail to adjust downward, resulting in involuntary unemployment. To prevent this situation, the optimal policy is to devalue the domestic currency, thereby reducing the real value of wages. As a result, both the model and the data show that default episodes are usually accompanied by significant currency devaluations \citep*{Na-18}.

For the sovereign debt model, I closely follow \citet*{Na-18}, as it allows me to match certain stylized facts about the sovereign debt defaults and examine the set of conditions where default is the optimal decision.
The calibrated model will then serve as a benchmark metric that allows us to examine whether China had set the heavily indebted poor counties into a default trap, following the method proposed by \citet*{Hinrichsen_2020-chapter4}.
