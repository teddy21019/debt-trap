\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-payment of debt service on the due date or within a specified grace period.
    \item Failure to make payments within the specified timeframe under a guarantee.
    \item Even in the absence of an outright payment default, creditors may experience significant economic losses on the sovereign debt they hold.
