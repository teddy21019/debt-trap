As described in Section \ref{sec: model-default-decision} and Appendix \ref{ap: default-set}, the default decision is jointly decided by the current debt level and its output for tradable goods during the period. Under a certain debt stock $d_t$, the less the tradable output $y^T_t$ it encounters, the lower the benefit a country receives.
Ultimately, if the output falls below a certain threshold value, it becomes optimal for the country to default.
\citet{Hinrichsen_2020-chapter4} compares the theoretical scenarios of defaulting with the actual data with a graphical default. He maps the default set evaluated via value function iteration into the state space, with the output as the horizontal axis and the debt level as the vertical axis. A grid on the space is colored in gray if the corresponding debt-output pair is \emph{not} in the default set. Figure~\ref{fig:ds} demonstrates the default set for Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The debt level in the default set plot differs between the two countries due to the difference in the targeted equilibrium debt-to-tradable-GDP ratio. As shown in the figure and proven in Appendix \ref{ap: default-set}, the upper limit of a default set (the intersection of the white and gray areas given a certain debt level) increases as the debt level increases, indicating that it requires a higher endowment of tradable output in order to incentivize the country to continue to fulfill its obligations to repay\footnote{
    In the default set depicted in \citet{Hinrichsen_2020-chapter4}, there is a discontinuity in the upper bound of the default set. This indicates that when the output level drops to a certain threshold, the country chooses to default, regardless of the current debt level. This is contradicted to the analytical conclusion proved in Proposition \ref{prop3} in Appendix \ref{ap: default-set}. During a private correspondence, the author acknowledged this mistake in his doctoral thesis, but he has already corrected it in his latest book.
}.

The actual data is then plotted on the default set for comparison. The output level corresponds to the cyclical component of the per capita tradable-GDP obtained by the HP-filter for the respective year.
The corresponding debt level is calculated by multiplying the debt-to-nominal-tradable-GDP ratio by the haircut ratio and 4 quarters. This calculation is necessary because the targeted debt level during calibration specifically refers to the unsecured portion of the debt, and thus the data should undergo the same calculation to accurately represent the unsecured debt component.

Furthermore, the debt data used in this analysis consists of two components: the debt stock excluding China obtained from the International Debt Statistics (IDS), and the debt stock specifically for China sourced from the database created by \citet*{Horn-Reinhart-Trebesch-21}. It is worth noting that Chinese government loans channeled through state-owned enterprises are typically not reported in the World Bank Debt Reporting System (DRS), which is the basis for IDS. This omission leads to an underestimation of the actual debt burden faced by the country. The additional loans provided by state-owned commercial banks, referred to as ``hidden debts'' by \citet*{Horn-Reinhart-Trebesch-21}, are included in their database. Consequently, in order to capture the total debt burden accurately, the total debt stock reported in IDS is adjusted by excluding the debt to China and adding the debt to China obtained from the database by \citet*{Horn-Reinhart-Trebesch-21}.

\subsection*{Default Decision for Sri Lanka}

Figure \ref{fig: ds-sri-data-with-china} plots the debt-output pair for Sri Lanka from 2007 to 2017. Each point represents the actual data pair for the year. Recall that China initiated its constructions in infrastructures such as the Hambantota International Port in 2007, and Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport in 2009. The selection of this time span allows us to examine the change in debt burden for Sri Lanka comprehensively in a chronological way.

As shown in the figure, at the initial phase of China's investment in 2007 and 2008, Sri Lanka is still under its safe zone of not defaulting, despite that it experienced a little drop in the output. Sri Lanka first landed into the default set during 2009, as debt to China reached \$3 billion. During 2010 and 2011, Sri Lanka ended its 25-years civil war, and experienced an unprecedented output growth. Agriculture sector in 2010 grew for 7\%, and industry sector grew for 8\%. This rapid increasing in GDP largely lowered the debt-to-tradable-GDP ratio, both in 2010 and 2011, and hence Sri Lanka was able to avoid the risk of default and stayed under the non-default set. However, as GDP growth in tradable good slowed down to a rate of 5\%, the debt to China increased by 6\%, which slowly pushed Sri Lanka to the brink of default. Eventually, in 2013, as total debt reached \$41 billion, in which China accounted for 13\%, Sri Lanka was again entering the default set. The status continued until 2016, with 2014 being an ambiguous exception.

It is worth mentioning that in 2015, Maithripala Sirisena defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa in presidential election, and promised to extricate Sri Lanka from the debt burden from China. However, according to Figure \ref{fig: ds-sri-data-with-china}, Sri Lanka was too indebted during 2015 and 2016, and it would be difficult for the new government to take actions besides undergoing debt restructuring. Eventually, in 2017, the infamous event of Sri Lanka leasing the Hambantota International Port for 99 years and selling 70\% of the stake to China Merchants Port stroke the headline. This action, however, did not write off the loans for the construction of the infrastructures, as it is used as a raise in money to repay debt to other official creditors \citep{Brautigam-meme-2020, Moramudali_2019}. Regardless of the narrative of whether the lease is involuntary or not, along with the outstanding output level in 2017, Sri Lanka was back to the non-default set after the lease.
Observe that all the cyclical components of the tradable goods (the x coordinate) are above 1 after 2011. This indicates that Sri Lanka is under the default set even when the output is above the steady state level of tradable outputs.

An intriguing question arises: What if the debt to China is not included, holding other conditions fixed? \citet{Hinrichsen_2020-chapter4} compares the debt for countries in war reparations with and without indemnities, and here I adopt the same approach. Figure \ref{fig: ds-sri-data-x-china} shows the comparison of the data. In the figure, the solid black dots represent data points including debts owed to China, while the gray dots represent data points excluding debts from China.
It is obvious that, \emph{ceteris paribus}, all years spanning from 2009 to 2017 are not under the default set. This is, indeed, an inexact comparison.
First, the debt level given in the model is endogenous, and we do not distinguish between China and other lenders. It is possible that Sri Lanka sought for other creditors for loans if the infrastructures were planned voluntarily, as mentioned in \citet{Brautigam-meme-2020}. In this case the debt level in the absence of China can be underestimated.
Second, the impact on GDP would be uncertain if China had not been involved in the construction of the infrastructure projects. For instance, \citet{Bandiera-Vasileios-BRI-debt} estimates from a long-term growth model that in 2020, the additional growth from investment on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is about 0.08\%.
Estimations of the extra growth due to investments during 2009 to 2017 are crucial in order to examine the counterfactual debt burden in the absence of China's intervention. If investments in China indeed contributed to the GDP growth during the periods, the debt-to-tradable-GDP ratio is also underestimated.
