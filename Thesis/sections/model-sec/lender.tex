The behavior of foreign lenders are not explicitly modeled in this framework, but as all rational agent, the expected marginal utility of lending to the domestic country must be equivalent to the opportunity cost of funds.
Let $r^*$ be the opportunity cost for the foreign lenders; this could be the world interest rate. Since $q_t$ is the price of debt that repays one unit of $d_{t+1}$ tomorrow, the return is $\frac{1}{q_t}$. The lenders take the risk of default into consideration, and hence the expected return will in fact be lower. Assume that foreign lenders are risk neutral, this gives
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lender}
    \frac{\Pr(I_{t+1}=1 \mid I_{t}=1)}{q_t} = 1 + r^* .
\end{equation}
