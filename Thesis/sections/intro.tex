As China's economic influence continues to grow, its lending practices to developing countries have come under scrutiny.
The concept of ``debt-trap diplomacy'' (hereinafter DTD), whereby China extends excessive loans to countries in exchange for political or economic concessions, has become a topic of heated debate \citep{Chellaney_2017}.
While some argue that the debt-trap problem poses a significant threat to the economic and political stability of vulnerable countries, others contend that it is overstated.

From the political science aspect, an analysis from the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs states that China utilizes DTD as a technique to achieve strategic objectives, such as projecting power across South Asian trading routes, undermining regional opposition to its South China Sea claims, and supporting its naval efforts to break out into the Pacific \citep*{Parker2018}.
Critics of this phenomenon argue that claims of DTD are often exaggerated or based on incomplete information. For example, \citet*{Brautigam-meme-2020} argues that the debt-trap is based on a flawed understanding of Chinese lending practices and the histories of the target countries, and that China is not strategically pursuing the DTD on developing countries.

The opacity in Chinese lending practices has been a longstanding challenge in the analysis of the DTD problem \citep*{Horn-Reinhart-Trebesch-21}.
The lack of transparency in the Chinese lending system, whereby loan terms, conditions and collateral requirements are not always disclosed to the borrowers, makes it difficult for economists and policymakers to fully grasp the magnitude of the issue.
Therefore, it has been challenging to assess the sustainability of debts of borrowing countries and their ability to service their obligations, as well as the potential impact of China's lending practices on the economy of low income developing countries (LIDC), especially those in the Belt and Road Initiatives (BLI).
As a result, recent studies on whether DTD is a myth have primarily been conducted normatively in the field of political science, rather than a positive economics analysis~\citep[See, e.g.,][]{Himmer2023-vn,Chen2020-eo}.

However, with the emergence of new and detailed data on Chinese lending practices, recent studies have begun to shed light on the nature and implications of the China debt.
In this thesis, I aim to shed light on whether a country fell into the debt-trap by applying a new and detailed data provided by \citet*{Horn-Reinhart-Trebesch-21}, hereinafter referred to the ``HRT database'', on the sovereign debt model proposed by \citet*{Na-18}, to provide insights into the sustainability of the debt of borrowing countries.
By calibrating the model for a particular country, a set of tradable-output levels which would cause the country to default could be obtained, given its current debt level. Following the approach of \citet{Hinrichsen_2020-chapter4}, this set is presented graphically with each data point on the space representing a debt-output pair for a specific year. This visual representation allows for an examination of whether the country has been in the default zone but has managed to avoid default due to other enforcement mechanisms, in this case might be the political leverage from China.

It requires a lot of work to calibrate all countries to match the model, therefore it is optimal to narrow down the sample countries to those that provides the most insight on the DID issue. I consider countries
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item that is constantly receiving loans from other international institutes,
    \item that indicates an increasing amount of debt from China that eventually exceeds other creditors, and
    \item in which China launches large infrastructure programs.
\end{enumerate*}
% \citet*{Hurley19-8-debt-trap} examines the dept-to-GDP ratio versus the share of China's debt, and identifies eight
% countries\footnote{
%     These countries are Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, the Maldives, Mongolia, Montenegro, Pakistan, and Tajikistan}
% that are particularly risky.
In particular, the default sets for Sri Lanka and Pakistan are examined in this thesis. I will further provide the basic backgrounds for the two sample countries in later sections.

The remaining chapters of the thesis are organized as follows:
In Chapter \ref{ch:lit}, a comprehensive literature review is conducted on the topics of Debt-trap diplomacy and sovereign default models.
Chapter \ref{ch:model} outlines the specific sovereign debt model that will be applied in this study.
Chapter \ref{ch:result} presents the calibration of the model and provides the corresponding empirical results.
Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes the thesis.
