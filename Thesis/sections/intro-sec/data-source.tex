\floatfoot{\emph{Notes:} Real GDP refers to using data in constant 2015 US dollars. The sector ``agriculture, forestry, and fishing'' is simplified as ``Agriculture'' in the table. ``Industry'' consists of mining, manufacturing, construction, electricity, water, and gas.
External debt to China has two sources: International Debt Statistics and \citet*{Horn-Reinhart-Trebesch-21}. In the empirical result throughout the thesis, the main data for the debt to China are from \citet*{Horn-Reinhart-Trebesch-21}, including loans from state-owned commercial banks as well. Data for the debt to China reported in International Debt Statistics do not contain this category and hence is marked ``part'' in the table.
