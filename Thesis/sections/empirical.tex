Typically, a model under the Eaton-Gersovitz framework does not have an analytical solution. Therefore, the optimal default set defined by \refeq{eq:default-set}, as well as the value functions and the policy functions, must be obtained numerically.
This requires the assignment of functional forms as well as structural parameters that matches the economy.
I follow the functional forms and the calibration approach introduced in \citet{Na-18} and \citet{Schmitt-Uribe-16}.
